before I share with you some what I do
knows I want to talk with you about what
I don't know but I have two older
brothers one was at High School in the
early 1970s and this was a time when a
High School GED got you a job all right
in the college degree was exemplary
my other brother Pat was in high school
in the early 80s and by this time the
GED wasn't enough to guarantee
employment you needed a college degree
and if you got one you had a pretty good
chance of getting the kind of job that
you wanted after you graduated now me I
graduated high school in 1988 got my
college degree in 1993.
and that college degree in 93 did not
mean as much it was not a ticket it was
not a voucher it was not a free pass go
to anything
so I asked the question what does your
college degree mean
it means you got an education
means you have more knowledge in a
specific subject vocation it means you
may have more expertise in what your
degree is in
but what's it worth
in the job market
out there today
we know the market for college graduates
is more competitive now than ever
now some of you already have a job lined
up you've got a path where today's job
is going to become tomorrow's career
but for most of you the future is
probably still pretty fuzzy
and you don't have that job that
directly reflects the degree you just
got
many of you don't even have a job at all
think about it you've just completed
your Scholastic educational curriculum
in life the one that you started when
you were five years old in kindergarten
up until now and your future
may not be any more clear than it was
five years ago
you don't have the answers and it's
probably pretty damn scary
and I say that's okay
because that is how it is this is the
reality that many of you are facing this
is the world that we live in the sooner
that we become less impressed
with our life with our accomplishments
with our career with whatever that
Prospect is in front of us the sooner we
become less impressed and more involved
with that and these things
the sooner we get a whole lot better at
doing them
so I'm going to talk to you about some
things I've learned in my journey most
from experience some of them I heard in
passing many of them I'm still
practicing but all of them I do believe
are true
now they may be truth to me but
don't think that that makes them mine
because you cannot own a truth so please
think of these as signpost approaches
paradigms
that gives some science
to satisfaction
they're yours to steal the years to
share like and do your own lives to
personally apply in your own lives in
your own way should you choose to
so here we go
number one this should come up on the
Jumbotron
life's not easy is it up there
life is not easy it is not don't try to
make it that way life's not fair it
never was it isn't now and it won't ever
be do not fall into the Trap the
entitlement trap of feeling like you're
a victim you are not get over it and get
on with it and yes most things are more
rewarding when you break a sweat to get
them number two
I love this unbelievable
is the stupidest word of the dictionary
should never come out of our mouths
think about it to say oh wow what an
unbelievable play uh it was an
unbelievable book an unbelievable film
an unbelievable Act of Courage
really
it may be spectacular it may be
phenomenal most excellent or outstanding
but unbelievable
give others and yourself more credit it
just happened you witnessed it you just
did it believe it what about the other
side of unbelievable you know that side
when we humans underperform or act out
of our best character for instance man
flies a suicide jet into the World Trade
Center
Millions die from diseases every day
that we have cures for Bob the Builder
swears that he's going to have your
house built by Thanksgiving and you
can't move in until Christmas the next
year
our best friends lie to us
and we lie to ourselves all the time
unbelievable
I don't think so
again it just happens and it happens
every day nothing that we Homo Sapien
earthlings do is unbelievable and if
there's one thing you can depend on
people being
it's people
so we shouldn't be surprised we us are
the trickiest mammals walking the planet
I'm not worried about the monkeys I'm
worried about you and me
happiness is an emotional response to an
outcome if I win I will be happy if I
don't I won't it's an if then cause and
effect quid pro quo standard that we
cannot sustain
because we immediately raise it every
time we attain it
you see happiness happiness Demands a
certain outcome it is result Reliant
and I say if happiness is what you're
after then you're going to be let down
frequently and you're going to be
unhappy much of your time
Joy though
Joy's a different thing it's something
else Joy is not a choice it's not a
response to some result it's a constant
Joy is the feeling that we have from
doing what we are fashioned to do no
matter the outcome
now personally as an actor I started
enjoying my work and literally being
more happy when I stopped trying to make
the daily labor a means to a certain end
for example I need this film to be a box
office success you know I need my
performance to be acknowledged I need
the respect of my peers and all those
are reasonable aspirations but the truth
is as soon as the work
the daily making of the movie The doing
of the deed became the reward in itself
for me
I got more box office more accolades and
respect than I ever had before
see Joy is always in process it's under
construction it is in constant approach
alive and well in the doing of what
we're fashioned to do
and enjoying
number four to find success for yourself
now check this out I'm in uh south of
New Orleans uh
I was going I went to a Voodoo shop
uh and they had this this wooden
partition against the wall at these
columns and in these columns where all
these vials of these magic potions right
and the headings above each potion
defining what they would give you were
things like fertility health uh family
legal help energy forgiveness
money
guess which column was empty
somebody please tell me where else
you're gonna have this much [ __ ] fun
let's admit it
money's King today is what make the
world makes the world go round it is
Success the more we have the more
successful we are right
now I would argue that our cultural
values have even been financialized
financialized humility is not in Vogue
anymore it's too passive
to get rich quick on the internet
richest 15 minutes of fame world that we
live in and we see it every day
but we all want to succeed right so the
question that we've got to ask ourselves
is what success is to us what success is
to you
is it more money that's fine I got
nothing against money
maybe it's a healthy family maybe it's a
happy marriage maybe it's to help others
to be famous to be spiritually sound
leave the world a little bit better
place than you found it
continue to ask yourself that question
now your answer may change over time and
that's fine
but do yourself this favor
whatever your answer is
don't choose anything that will
jeopardize yourself
prioritize who you are who you want to
be and don't spend time with anything
that antagonizes your character don't
drink the Kool-Aid man it tastes sweet
but you will get cavities tomorrow all
right life is not a popularity contest
be brave take the hill but first answer
that question what's my hill
so me how do I how do I define success
for me myself well for me it's a
measurement of five things
we got fatherhood we got being a good
husband we got my health mind body and
spirit we've got career and we got
friendships these are what's important
to me in my life right now so I try to
measure these five things each day I
check in with them I like to see whether
or not I'm in the the debit section or
the credit section with each one am I in
the in the redder I'm in the black you
follow
for instance sometimes say my career is
rolling all right it's way up here in
the black but I see how my relationship
with my wife
maybe could use a little bit more of my
attention I got to pick up the slack on
being a better husband
get that one out of the red or say my
spiritual health could use some
maintenance it's down here but hey man
my friendships and my social life
they're in high gear right
I got to recalibrate
checks and balances I gotta go to church
remember to say thank you more often
something but I got to take the tally
because I want to keep all five
in healthy shape and I know that if I
don't take care of them if I don't keep
up maintenance on them one of them is
going to get weak man
it's going to dip too deep into the
debit section it's going to go bankrupt
it's going to get sick
died
so first we have to define success for
ourselves and then we have to put in the
work to maintain it take that daily
tally attend our garden keep the things
that are important to us in good shape
I mean let's admit it
we've all got two wolves a good one
and a battle and they both want to eat
the best I can tell we just got to feed
that good one a little more than the
other one
there we go number five
[Music]
don't leave crumbs and the beauty of
delayed gratification so what are crumbs
or the crumbs I'm talking about are the
choices that we make that make us have
to look over our shoulder
in the future
you didn't pay that guy back the money
that you owed him and tonight you just
saw him three rows behind you
[ __ ]
you slept around on your spouse and you
just found out that tomorrow she and the
lady you're having an affair with are
going to be at the same PTA meeting
[ __ ] again
you drank too much last night you're too
hungover to drive your son to his 8 A.M
Saturday morning baseball practice these
are the crumbs
they come in the form of regret
guilt and remorse you leave trumps today
they will cause you more stress tomorrow
and they disallow you from creating a
customized future in which you do not
have to look over your shoulder
so let's flip the script
instead of creating outcomes that take
from us let's create more outcomes that
pay us back
fill us up
keep your fire lit turn you on for the
most amount of time in your future
these are the choices I'm talking about
and this is the beauty of delayed
gratification
I tee yourself up do yourself a favor
make the choices the purchases today
that pay you back tomorrow residuals
in my business we call it mailbox money
if I do my job well today and that movie
keeps re-running on TV five years from
now I'm getting checks in the mailbox
it's a heck of a deal so whether it's
prepping the coffee maker the night
before so all you got to do is press the
button in the morning
or getting ready for the job interview
early so you don't have to cram the
night before or choose not to hook up
with that married woman because you know
you're going to feel horrible about it
tomorrow
and your husband Carries a Gun
or paying your debts on time so that
when you do see that guy three rows back
tonight you don't have to hunker down on
your seat hoping that he don't see you
get some Roi
you know what that is
return on investment your investment you
customize your future don't leave drums
